Challenge 1

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    Changed div in header to nav element and updated .css file to associate rules accordingly
    
    Added ID to SEO section
    Changed divs in content container to article elements

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
    Changed header from div element to header element

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
    Modified text to "Horiseon"
